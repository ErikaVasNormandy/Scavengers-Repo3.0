## saturday-morning-bloodborne
It's kind of become a thing for me to bust out the charcoal and ink. I used to do this in cafes every Saturday morning but now I just do it on the front porch while watching the sun rise

## amateur-concept-artist
Really a lot of character design practice here, most being based off of roleplaying campaigns. I started really wanting to improve when I realized how long it took me just to write short pieces, and I hope I can breathe some life into the campaigns that people weave :)

## inktober
Sometimes pen and paper is all you want

## scrapbook
There's no way to improve if you don't practice
